2. Double-click `index.html` to open in any modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).
3. **Important:** Click anywhere on the page once to enable the Audio Context (browser security polic).

## 🎹 Key Features
- **Boot Screen:** System check animation on load.
- **Audio Engine:** Sound effects for UI interactions.
- **Launchpad:** Press `A`, `S`, `D`, `F` on your keyboard to play beats.

## ⚠️ Notes
- The "Matter.js" physics engine is included via CDN in the code but local logic handles the interactions.
- No external server is required; runs purely on client-side HTML/JS.

Enjoy the beat. 🎧
